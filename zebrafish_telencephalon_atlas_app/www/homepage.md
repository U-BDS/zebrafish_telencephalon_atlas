### FAQs:

1. Why can't I find my gene?

	Users of the app should be aware of the feature to search by gene IDs for cases when a gene name is not assigned during the generation of the cell matrices. Please see the "Gene name search" help icon at the upper right corner of the `Choose a gene` option for more information including reference genome source and versions.

2. How do I add genes to generate a `DotPlot`?

	Gene / feature inputs for a `DotPlot` should be performed by uploading a csv file. For more information, please see the helper icon by `DotPlot option: upload CSV file of gene names`.
