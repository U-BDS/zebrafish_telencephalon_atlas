### Gene name search
___

Gene names entered in the search box are automatically converted to the zebrafish nomenclature (e.g.: `SNAP25A`, or `Snap25a`, are all read by the app as `snap25a`).

However, some gene names in the comprehensive zebrafish annotation do not yet follow standard nomenclature (or do not yet have an official gene symbol at the time the data was processed with selected annotation version). A couple of examples include `si:ch211-51e12.7` and `TULP3`.

Thus, to enter these gene names and avoid automatic conversion from the app, simply enter the name inside double quotes, `""` (e.g.: `"si:ch211-51e12.7"` or `"TULP3"`).
