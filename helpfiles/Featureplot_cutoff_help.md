### FeaturePlot scale
___

Choose a maximum cutoff for expression scale. A few notes on this feature:

1. The scale of the FeaturePlot can only be seen under the setting `All` in `Choose all or split by age` option available in the integrated dataset. Despite not being shown when FeaturePlots are split, the scale is the same when the dataset is split across ages.

2. When you set a maximum value under this option, be sure to hit `Reset scale` when you search for another gene as this is not automatically reset.
